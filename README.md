# Oracle JET for Developers
This is the code repository for [Oracle JET for Developers](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/oracle-jet-developers?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787284746), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
This book will give you a complete practical understanding of the Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit (JET) and how you can use it to develop efficient client-side applications with ease. It will tell you how to get your own customized Oracle JET set up.

You'll start with individual libraries, such as jQuery, Cordova, and Require.js. You'll also get to work with the JavaScript libraries created by Oracle, especially for cloud developers. You'll use these tools to create a working backend application with these libraries. Using the latest Oracle Alta UI, you'll develop a state-of-the-art backend for your cloud applications. You'll learn how to develop and integrate the different cloud services required for your application and use other third-party libraries to get more features from your cloud applications.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapter 10 doesn't have code files.

The code will look like the following:
```
 <td data-bind='text: name'></td>
```

To follow along with this book, you'll need a computer with an internet connection. You can choose to work online on a JSFiddle kind of cloud web environment to practice the examples. I recommend that you have the NetBeans IDE with Grunt, Oracle JET, and the HTML5 extension along with a Chrome browser containing the NetBeans runner.
